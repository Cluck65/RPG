    - I'll give you some of these pokeballs to get you started too, but be careful,
      I heard there's a shortage.
    - Brother gave you 5 pokeballs!
    - Now.. I was hoping you could bring me a parcel from the next town?
    - It won't take long. It'll give you a chance to try out your new pokemon too!
    - Just meet my guy in the poke center in the next town up. He'll get you the
      package. Thanks!
